# Customer Segmentation using K-means and PCA

Customer segmentation is an inevitable undertaking for any type of business. It assists to understand the customers better by grouping them into clusters. The awareness of these clusters can be used to enhance various business operations such as targeted marketing campaigns and developement of products to name a few.

The project uses Python programming language executed in Jupyter Notebooks.

You will need to install various Python libraries to run the code.

If you have not installed Python on your computer, it is advisable to install the Anaconda distribution of Python, which will install most of the packages required to run the code easily.
